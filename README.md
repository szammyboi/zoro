## About The Project

There are a variety of tools out there to assist in setting up build systems and commands such as CMake, Premake, and Bazel. However, these tools can often be cumbersome and have odd syntaxes. This project aims to create a simple interface for build systems by using the pre-established yaml file format as the structure.

## Roadmap

- YAML File Specification for Projects/Workspaces
- Ninja File Generation
- Visual Studio File Generation
- Custom Modularity
